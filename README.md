# eb-py-flask-signup-worker
This Python sample application illustrates the worker role functionality of AWS Elastic Beanstalk. It is designed to process messages generated by the [frontend sample app](https://github.com/awslabs/eb-py-flask-signup). Messages contain a customer's name and e-mail address, and the worker app uses SES to deliver an e-mail to the address in the message.

## Message Format
To test the worker app without the frontend, you can manually enqueue messages of the following format:

    {
        "name" : "Bender B. Rodriguez",
        "email" : "bender@ilovebender.com"
    }

## IAM Role Permissions
The worker role must run in an IAM role with permissions to SES and SQS. An example policy is included in [iam_policy.json](iam_policy.json).
